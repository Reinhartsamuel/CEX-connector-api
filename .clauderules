- Tech Stack: Bun, Hono, PostgreSQL (Drizzle), TypeScript.

- Constraint: Never suggest "optimistic UI" updates for backend reconciliation.

- Database: All financial state changes must be wrapped in a PostgreSQL transaction in /src/db/schemas.ts

- Websockets: Use a sequence-number based reconciliation. If a sequence is skipped, trigger a REST API fallback immediately to sync state.

- Documentation: Strictly follow the Hyperliquid technical specs provided. Do not guess field names.
